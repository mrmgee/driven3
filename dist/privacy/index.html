<h3>Device Identifiers, Cookies, and Other Tracking</h3>
<p>The Site uses unique device identifiers ("UDID"), "cookies" or other tracking capabilities to enhance User experience. The UDID is an identifier that uniquely identifies Your device and allows the Site to recognize You and Your device when You return to the Site. Cookies are small text files that are placed on Your device that help identify Your device and may allow some tracking of information. Cookies, UDID and the other tracking technologies used by the Site are intended to improve User experience. For example, the cookies or UDID can help the Site remember You between visits. You can set Your device to refuse cookies, or to alert You when cookies are being sent. However, if You refuse cookies, certain areas of the Site may not work as designed. However, the information from the UDID is only used to make the Site work as well as possible for You.</p>
<h3>Google Analytics Notice</h3>
<p>We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies to analyze traffic on the Site. For instance, Google Analytics tells us how many people have used the Site, how they move through the Site, and how long they spend on each area of the Site. We typically do not connect this analytical information with identifiable information like name or phone number, although the analytics may associate information with a geographic location, device identifier, or IP address.</p>

<h3>How Can You Correct This Information?</h3>
<p>You can send an email to "Contact Us" (below) asking that information be corrected.</p>
<h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
<p>We have implemented reasonable safeguards that help assure that We commit to collect, process and use personal information in accordance with applicable laws. We keep personal information in an encrypted state, whether at rest or in transit. However, it is not possible to keep data encrypted when it is in use, and it is not possible to guarantee that any transfer of information over the Internet or electronic data storage is 100% secure. As a result, We cannot guarantee the absolute security of Your information. While We have implemented security measures, You transmit data, including personal information, to us at Your own risk.</p>
<h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
<p>We retain personally identifiable information only as long as it is needed for permissible business purposes, as required by law, and in accordance with record retention policies. Upon expiration of the retention period, personally identifiable information is disposed of in a secure manner.</p>
<h3>How Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h3>

<p>Residents of California and Nevada have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information. Residents of other states can request that their information not be sold by contacting us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@drivengarage.com" rel="nofollow">customerservice@drivengarage.com</a>.</p>
<p>We may share the personal information listed above about Users of the Site:</p>
<ul>
    <li>With our customers, trusted affiliates and advertisers to help provide services that are described above.</li>
    <li>With third party service providers that help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf.</li>
    <li>With data aggregators.</li>
    <li>With companies that provide services to us, such as hosting services and the Site stores.</li>
    <li>With companies that are disclosed to You at the time You provide the Information.</li>
    <li>As permitted or required by law; for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or to prevent or investigate a crime or fraud. We may share information if necessary to enforce this Privacy Policy or Terms of Use of the Site. We reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies information or activities that We, in good faith, believe to be harmful or unlawful, with or without providing notice to You.</li>
</ul>
<p>When We share personal information for a business purpose, We enter into an agreement that sets forth the purpose of the sharing of personal information and that the recipient must keep that personal information confidential and not use it for purposes other than performance of the contract.</p>
<h3>California Residents: What Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Information?</h3>
<p>When it comes to personal information, You have rights. This includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You have the right to request information regarding the categories of information that have been collected about You, the purpose for collecting or selling that information, the categories of third parties with whom the information has been shared; and the specific data that has been collected.</li>
    <li>You have the right to have information corrected if You think it is misleading or incorrect, if You can tell us why it is incorrect.</li>
    <li>You may request that We delete personal information that relates to You if We are not required to keep it for legal reasons.</li>
    <li>You may request We do not sell Your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us <a href="mailto:customerservice@drivengarage.com" rel="nofollow">customerservice@drivengarage.com</a></p>
<p>We will confirm receipt of your request and ask you to confirm your identity in order to fulfill these requests. If you would like someone else to make such a request on your behalf, they may do so.</p>
<p>We will not discriminate against You if You exercise any of Your rights.</p>
<h3>Third Party Links</h3>
<p>Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not endorse the products of those companies, do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies. We encourage You to read the terms and policies of any third-party site or service You navigate to.</p>
<h3>Protecting Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>The Site is intended to be used by individuals over the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If We become aware that We have collected personal information from a child under 13 years of age, We will promptly remove such information. If You believe We have collected information from Your child, please notify us through "Contact Us".</p>
<h3>California Do Not Track Notice</h3>
<p>Many internet browsers have "Do Not Track" features which, when turned on, send a signal (the "DNT signal") to the websites a user visits that indicates the use does not want to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT signals, and there is no common definition of "tracking", We do not currently respond to DNT signals on the Site. We engage in targeted behavioral advertising.</p>
</h3>Your California "Shine the Light" Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>Upon Your request, submitted through "Contact Us", We will advise You of any categories of personal information that We disclose to third parties, and (to the extent We know) whether those third parties use that information for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>If We provide Your personal information to a third party, We do not allow that third party to use that information for marketing their services, unless You have consented to that use.</p>
<h3>Updating Your Information</h3>
<p>If Your information needs to be updated, corrected, or deleted, please notify us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@drivengarage.com" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customerservice@drivengarage.com</a>. Your personal information can only be deleted in accordance with our data retention policy, and as permitted by law. Further, personal information may remain in databases, access logs, backup media, and other records. We cannot update or remove information from records of third parties.</p>
