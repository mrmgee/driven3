<h3>Device Identifiers, Cookies, and Other Tracking</h3>

Cookies, UDID and the other tracking technologies used by the Site are intended to improve User experience. For example, the cookies or UDID can help the Site remember You between visits. You can set Your device to refuse cookies, or to alert You when cookies are being sent. However, if You refuse cookies, certain areas of the Site may not work as designed. However, the information from the UDID is only used to make the Site work as well as possible for You.</p>

<h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
<p>We have implemented reasonable safeguards that help assure that We commit to collect, process and use personal information in accordance with applicable laws. We keep personal information in an encrypted state, whether at rest or in transit. However, it is not possible to keep data encrypted when it is in use, and it is not possible to guarantee that any transfer of information over the Internet or electronic data storage is 100% secure.

<h3>California Residents: What Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Information?</h3>

<p>We will not discriminate against You if You exercise any of Your rights.</p>

<h3>Third Party Links</h3>
<p>Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not endorse the products of those companies, do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.

<p>The Site is intended to be used by individuals over the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.

If You believe We have collected information from Your child, please notify us through "Contact Us".</p>
<h3>California Do Not Track Notice</h3>
<p>Many internet browsers have "Do Not Track" features which, when turned on, send a signal (the "DNT signal") to the websites a user visits that indicates the use does not want to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT signals, and there is no common definition of "tracking", We do not currently respond to DNT signals on the Site. We engage in targeted behavioral advertising.</p>
</h3>Your California "Shine the Light" Privacy Rights</h3>
<p>Upon Your request, submitted through "Contact Us", We will advise You of any categories of personal information that We disclose to third parties, and (to the extent We know) whether those third parties use that information for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
<p>If We provide Your personal information to a third party, We do not allow that third party to use that information for marketing their services, unless You have consented to that use.</p>
<h3>Updating Your Information</h3>
<p>If Your information needs to be updated, corrected, or deleted, please notify us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@drivengarage.com" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customerservice@drivengarage.com</a>. Your personal information can only be deleted in accordance with our data retention policy, and as permitted by law.
