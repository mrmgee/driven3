    text: Modern engine swaps are a great way to make your classic car more powerful, reliable and efficient - but along with the engine itself, we also need to modernize the transmission, fuel system, cooling system, exhaust and more. These parts add up and often surprise a customer before they even pull the trigger on a swap.

      - que: I have a used engine my buddy gave me - can you install it?
        ans: We can - but be aware that you are paying for labor - and used parts can have issues. 
      - que: I want to buy a crate engine online and have it shipped to you. Can I do that?
        ans: We would rather spec, and purchase the parts for you. We buy in volume wholesale and can meet or beat most online pricing - and make sure you get the right stuff.
      - que: Can you guys re-build my engine for me?
        ans: We don’t do engine machine work in house - but we do work with several reputable shops to do this work. We either have the machine shop assemble the engine - or in some cases we do the assembly in house.
