    text: A stock LS3 or Coyote - or most modern engines are set up form the factory for boost - but there are limits. Before you add horses to the barn, we need to make sure the barn can fit them. If your bottom end is not up to snuff on your engine, adding boost may cause it to blow up.

    text: We love superchargers here - the power is linear, with no lag from turbo spool-up. But the turbo vs supercharger question really lies in the engine application - and the goals for the build. Looking for streetable boost? In most cases a supercharger (or blower) fits the bill. Looking for power on the top end? A turbo might be the way to go. There is no right or wrong answer.

    text: A simple power adder is putting on a nitrous shot (NOS or “Laughing gas”). This can be added to most set-ups without an insane amount of work. Again - adding power, means that the lower end components need to be able to handle it - or else… BOOM!

    qaCont:
      - que: Will I need my car tuned if I add a supercharger or turbo?
        ans: Most definitely! You have to take into account that adding more air, requires more fuel - and all at the right time. So tuning is absolutely necessary.
      - que: Can you add turbos to my carbureted car?
        ans: It can be done… but requires a carb or throttle body capable of blow through.
      - que: How much horsepower can we add?
        ans: There’s no hard or fast rule here - it is different for every engine combination.

Power adders can help you squeeze more horsepower out of your engine by adding more air to burn and increasing power.
