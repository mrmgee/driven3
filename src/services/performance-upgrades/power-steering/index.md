    text: When it comes to power steering conversions we can choose to add stock components, or upgrade. Upgrades from reputable companies are usually the best choice if available to fit your ride. These companies have taken the time, and engineering to create systems that use newer components to get your car steering easier. Quicker ratio steering boxes that don’t use antiquated parts, and pumps that are made with all new components.

Sometimes for a rack conversion we’ll also need to do a  front suspension upgrade to make it happen - but either way, we can handle it.
