    text: From simple radiator upgrades, adding an electric fan, or even attacking the source with an oil or trans cooler we can help keep you from sweating bullets while sitting in traffic on a hot summer day. We start with the basics - making sure the thermostat is working, timing is right and the car is not running lean - then offer the best upgrade for your ride.

    text: Ditch that wimpy, old, clogged radiator for a larger capacity aluminum radiator to help keep your engine cool while waiting to get into the car show. We use quality parts from known suppliers and can handle having custom radiators made to handle any cooling need.

    text: Many people think if they remove the thermostat the engine coolant will circulate faster, and the engine will run cooler. It’s exactly the opposite in most cases. The thermostat modulates the coolant temps, and slows the flow down so that the radiator has time to cool the liquid as it passes by the fins.

    text: Many times - we just need to make sure that your fan and shroud are working right. The fan shroud needs to be on to direct the air - and the fan needs to be within the shroud to function right. We have even seen electric fans wired wrong - so they don’t work right. Sometimes it can be the simple thing.

    text: Many classic and muscle car cooling problems only appear when stuck in traffic. It’s the worst… in line to get into the car show for 30 min and your ride overheats. The problem is that in traffic, there is little air moving by the radiator to cool the engine coolant down. Adding an electric fan with a proper controller / shroud usually kills this issue 110%.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
    qaCont:
      - que: My radiator is leaking…. Can you repair it?
        ans: If it’s newer, and was damaged - probably. If it’s an older radiator we’ll likely recommend replacement.
      - que: My car only heats up in traffic… on the highway it’s cool as can be.
        ans: Perfect candidate for an electric fan upgrade.
      - que: I put an electric fan on the front of my radiator and it doesn’t help.
        ans: Doing this rarely works… You need a “Puller” fan on the inside with a sealed shroud to pull the heat through the radiator.
