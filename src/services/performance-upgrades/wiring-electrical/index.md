    text: Your electrical system is one of the most important yet overlooked parts of your vehicle. For most people, it’s out of sight and out of mind. Turn signals or nonfunctional gauges may indicate deeper electrical problems. We'll diagnose your car's entire system to make it work — and safe.

    text: We will troubleshoot and diagnose any electrical issue. A complete rewire is sometimes the best solution. The wiring in most classic cars is old, brittle and beyond its usable life - a complete re-wire takes care of all of the issues at once - instead of circuits failing one at a time and leaving you stranded, tow, repair - then do it all again.

    text: We keep the wires as hidden as possible. Not only does this give a clean finish without wires crisscrossing the engine, it protects the wires from heat and moving components. All connections are crimped, and shrink tubed to provide years of trouble-free service.

    text: <p>Replacing a wiring harness requires removing the old one first. Accessing the wiring involves removing panels, seats, carpet, parts of the engine, light assemblies etc.</p><p>Even new kits are never truly "plug and play". Modifications and customizations are always required to get your electrical system back in order.</p>

      - que: My wiring is a mess - can you just help me clean it up?
        ans: Totally - but once we see it in person we may have to go deeper.
      - que: Most of the stuff in my car works - but the lights don’t work all the time - can you just get that stuff going?
        ans: Sure - but just like when you go to the doctor - we need to diagnose the root cause of the problem. Is it the switch? Is it the wiring? Is it the turn signal or “Combination” switch? Until the doctor can test - we don’t know.
      - que: I keep replacing the battery - and it keeps dying - what gives?
        ans: Could be other issues - like a bad alternator or voltage regulator causing a drain on the battery. Many failed components can cause issues - and we need to find the source of the drain.
