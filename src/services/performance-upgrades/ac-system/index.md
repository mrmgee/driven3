      - que: My car from the 60’s already has air - can you make it work?
        ans: In some cases, yes - In most cases even if we do a conversion to modern refrigerant the results are underwhelming. You may spend almost as much as a new retrofit system that will work better.
      - que: Can you put AC in any vehicle?
        ans: With very few exceptions - we can get a system in 99% of vehicles.
      - que: My AC stopped working - can you fix it.
        ans: We’re happy to diagnose the issue and get you driving cool again.
