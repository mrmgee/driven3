The specific upgrades you choose will depend on your car, your budget, and your driving style. But no matter what you choose, you're sure to notice a difference in the way your car drives.

    text: Just adding a sway bar to your current set-up can make cornering more predictable and help with body roll. It’s not an extensive modification for most cars. This along with some new ball joints, bushings, and service work can go a long way.

    qaCont:
      - que: Will a coil over conversion make my car ride softer?
        ans: In most cases, no - coil overs suspension will be stiffer - but the predictable handling and increased control may be worth it.
      - que: Can you improve handling and suspension without a full swap?
        ans: Yes! In many cases just replacing worn components like bushings, ball joints, tie rod ends and shocks can make a world of difference.
      - que: I want airbags, but have heard they are “Bouncy”?
        ans: We can do a coil-over with an airbag on top like Ride Tech “Shockwaves” that give you the stance you are looking for, and a great ride quality.
