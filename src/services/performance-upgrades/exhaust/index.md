    text: Performance exhaust systems can lead to better throttle response and increased horsepower and torque due to reduced backpressure and improved exhaust flow. Classic car owners looking to enhance acceleration and overall power delivery often opt for performance exhausts.

    text: Even when we install off the shelf kits, we prefer to fit them closer to the body, weld slip joints and install welded V-Band style clamps in for serviceability. Does it cost more to go here - sure…. But the end product is a much cleaner install.

    text: We specialize in custom Tig Welded stainless steel exhaust. Each system is custom made starting from the headers back and is truly a work of art. We painstakingly fit a custom system to get it as far away from the ground and around complex suspensions. All the tubing we use is 16ga. Food grade 304 stainless that is mandrel bent and hand Tig Welded.

    text: A great set of headers can add that muscle car sound - and increase flow from the engine to the exhaust system. Headers can be tricky to get to fit right, and tricky to get to seal up - but we do them all the time. We can spec the right stuff and get it installed the right way.
