    text: A front disc brake upgrade is one of the best things you can do to most classic cars. Remember, when these cars were built - the playing field was a bit more even with most cars having drum brakes. Now you have to worry about the soccer mom in her lexus who can outbrake your car by 100’s of feet.

    text: More than just disc conversions - we can do power brakes as well. Even “Hydroboost brakes” that use power steering pressure for assist. We can match the best components for your needs and get your ride stopping on a dime.

    text: We’ve seen it a bunch… Customer buys “no name” disc brake kit online and asks us to install it. Most of these kits use off the shelf parts from 20 year old cars and some brackets. They rarely fit right and can take 2x longer to install. We prefer to spec a good engineered component from a company like Wilwood Engineering, Brembo, Baer, etc. The kit was engineered for the car - and can generally be installed in half the time of some cobbled together “Kit”.  You save in the long run by saving on Labor hours - $400 saved on the cheap kit can end up costing you $800 in hours to install. You also get a superior product that adds resale to the car.

    text: A braking system has many components. And when swapping to front (or 4 wheel) disc brakes we also need to change the lines, and most importantly the brake master cylinder. You can’t use a drum/drum master for a disc/drum set-up.

    text: Have to hammer those brakes to get the car to stop? Or is your pedal “Touchy” sending the car into a screech without much pressure. Pedal ratio may be the issue - we can get to the root of this issue and get you stopping safely.

      - que: Do you work on drum brakes as well?
        ans: Totally! A well set up drum brake system can work just fine - especially just in the rear. We can service drum brakes on most any vehicle.
      - que: Do I need 4 wheel disc brakes?
        ans: Typically, a front disc conversion is all you need for most cars - rear brakes only handle about 10-20% of your cars braking - so in most cases a front upgrade is fine.
      - que: I have a big cam, and my power brakes are horrible. Can you help?
        ans: Totally! Big cam engines are perfect for hydroboost set-ups, We can also do an electric vacuum pump as well to help at idle.
