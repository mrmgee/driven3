    text: A modern braking system makes it easier to stop and improves handling. This can be especially helpful if you have a classic car with a lot of horsepower. New brakes are more effective than their old-school counterparts, so you can stop your car in a shorter distance. This can be a lifesaver in an emergency situation.

    text: We’ve seen it a bunch… Customer buys “no name” disc brake kit online and asks us to install it. Most of these kits use off the shelf parts from 20 year old cars and some brackets. They rarely fit right and can take 2x longer to install. We prefer to spec a good engineered component from a company like Wilwood Engineering, Brembo, Baer, etc. The kit was engineered for the car - and can generally be installed in half the time of some cobbled together “Kit”.  You save in the long run by saving on Labor hours - $400 saved on the cheap kit can end up costing you $800 in hours to install. You also get a superior product that adds resale to the car.

    text: A braking system has many components. And when swapping to front (or 4 wheel) disc brakes we also need to change the lines, and most importantly the brake master cylinder. You can’t use a drum/drum master for a disc/drum set-up.

    text: Have to hammer those brakes to get the car to stop? Or is your pedal “Touchy” sending the car into a screech without much pressure. Pedal ratio may be the issue - we can get to the root of this issue and get you stopping safely.
