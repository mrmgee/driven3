    text: A posi traction or limited slip carrier can be a great upgrade for your classic car. We can spec and install a new carrier, gears and bearings and get your burnouts turned up from a “1” to “11”.

    text: Let us swap your ring and pinion for the right combo to get those RPMs down at cruise. We can install a new gearset that keeps some of the performance of a tall gear - but brings you down to a cruise level.

    text: There’s a lot of cheap components out there for differentials. We prefer to use brand names we trust in your final drive. There’s no need to skimp here as failure will take out everything in the rear end.

    text: We can cut and narrow your axles to allow for wider tires. We have the right tools and equipment to cut and line up the new flanges, and on staff certified welders to stitch the new ends on.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
    qaCont:
      - que: How wide of a tire can I fit?
        ans: That depends - sometimes custom wheels are the answer rather than narrowing your rear end. Sometimes not. We can get your car in and measure and try some tires on our wheel fit tool to give you an idea of where to go.
      - que: What’s the right rear end gear ratio?
        ans: There’s no easy answer here - it depends on the transmission final drive, the tire size and the RPM at cruise Vs. off the line performance we are looking for. There is no easy answer - but it can be solved with math.
      - que: I want to keep my out of the hole performance but want less RPMs at cruise - can you help?
        ans: This may be less of a differential gear issue - and more of a final drive ratio issue - requiring changing the transmission from a 3-speed to 4-speed, or adding a Gear Vendors Overdrive unit. Either way, we can help.
