    text: Serpentine conversions are more compact in most engine bays - so beside adding function they will give more room for other components. We can spec the right set-up that works with your car whether it has AC or not, and give it a super slick look up front.

    text: We work with many manufacturers to get the right set-up for you cars need - and the right upgraded components that the belt runs on. Looks are one thing, but we like function as much as form and want the best stuff that will last as well as look awesome.

    text: It’s not just the brackets. Most of the serpentine conversion kits we spec have all new components that are a bit more modern than one you have. Things like 1 wire high output alternators, Better power steering pumps and when you want AC - a serpentine conversion is usually a no brainer.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
    qaCont:
      - que: My car doesn’t have power steering - can I add it with a serpentine drive?
        ans: In most cases, yes! But we will also have to add a power steering gear or rack as well.
      - que: I keep throwing v belts - do I need a serp drive?
        ans: Maybe - but most belt throwing problems are related to improper pulley alignment. A serp drive will cure that - but we can also just align you pulleys with the stuff you have.
      - que: Which brand is the best for a serpentine conversion?
        ans: It really depends on the engine you are putting it on - and in some cases the look you are going for. We can guide your choice based on what we know - and our design eye.
