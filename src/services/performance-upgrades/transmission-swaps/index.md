    text: We’ve done a ton of upgrades to cars with automatic transmissions over the years. Ditch that 2 speed powerglide or 3 speed auto and put in a 4 speed automatic and enjoy lower highway cruise RPMS, firmer shifts and a bit of fuel economy. We can handle it all from the trans to the shifter and driveline with matched components for your car.

    text: Whether we are adding a gear to your automatic, or swapping out for a manual trans - we want to make sure you get the right blend of power and drivability. Part of a trans swap is also taking into account the rear gears and tire size and calculating the best torque converter, gear ratios and other things to make everything work well together.

    text: Call it an anti-theft device if you want - but nothing beats the thrill of controlling your car’s power than a manual trans. We specialize in hydraulic clutches - making your beast shift as easy as a BMW with little pedal input needed. We match the clutch components and driveline to your expected use and performance level and can dial it all in for you.

    text: At Driven Garage we have done 4 speed swaps in restored cars and can keep the original shifter intact by modifying the shift gate and using a linkage that doesn’t require us to ditch the originality of your interior. This allows you to keep the original look but get the advantage of that extra gear.

    text: For a 4 speed auto swap, you can expect to spend around $3,000 for parts, and $2,000 - $2,500 in labor. Manual swaps will require 20-25%+ more for parts and labor than an auto.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
    qaCont:
      - que: My car is screaming at 4000 rpm on the highway - and I have a 3 speed auto. Do I need a 4 speed or can I just change my gear ratio?
        ans: Totally doable with one caveat - to get the RPM’s down with gears alone - off the line performance may suffer.
      - que: I want to keep my 3 speed auto - but it’s tired - can you re-build mine?
        ans: No problem, we can handle re-builds as well.
      - que: My clutch is super stiff - can you make it easier?
        ans: Sounds like you need a hydraulic throwout conversion - we can do this on almost any car and make your clutch work like a late model car.
