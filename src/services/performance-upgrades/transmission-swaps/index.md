    text: Transmission swap can enhance your car’s speed and the way it handles engine power. It will also give you more control and improve your overall riding experience. Changing the transmission may be the easiest way to completely transform your driving experience from ho-hum into a gear-shifting rocket you can't wait to take cruising.

    text: Whether you’re looking for a high-performance experience behind the wheel or are just looking to make you commute easier, we’ve got you covered. Take control with a manual gearbox to precisely put your engine’s power to work. A modern automatic transmission in your classic will make quick runs out for coffee or driving to work more comfortable. We won’t judge, just give you the best setup to match your driving style.

    text: We custom match components to your application based not just on brand name - but your goals for performance and reliability. We don’t cheap out on plumbing and fittings - because who likes to watch their car burn to the ground? We spec in-tank fuel pumps with a return system every time, and have seen the failures not doing this causes. Is it harder or more expensive to do it right? Yes…. But our experience tells us to do it right and pay now, or re-do it later and pay again.
