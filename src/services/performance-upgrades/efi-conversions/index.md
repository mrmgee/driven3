    text: Here’s how we do it right, and how to get the best experience from your EFI install. We’ve been ripping carburetors off and replacing them with throttle body EFI since George W. Bush was in the White House. After thousands of installs from every brand that makes these “Kits” -  we know what works well. We’re picky about the parts choice as well as how these systems are installed as we’ve seen what works best in real world driving on our own cars as well as customers rides.

    text: EFI isn’t a magic bullet that solves poor running conditions - but it can make your car easier to start both when cold and hot and increase overall reliability in most driving conditions.

    text: With a few components we can add timing control to most EFI systems. This enables the EFI computer to control the timing curve on your engine as well as the fuel map. This allows us to dial in your advance curve to make your car more responsive and put the fuel and timing map in concert to help make the most power at the right time.

      - que: Will my car pass smog if I switch to EFI?
        ans: In most cases, yes - but with exceptions. We’ve done conversions on smog era vehicles with California legal components in the past - but we need to spec the right components for you. We can’t do this for every vehicle - but kits are available for a surprisingly wide range from various companies.
      - que: What will happen to my gas mileage if I upgrade to EFI?
