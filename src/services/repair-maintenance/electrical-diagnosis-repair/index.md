    text: The “blinker switch” or combination switch in your steering column not only controls your left and right blinkers - but it also switches power for most of the lights on your car to work properly. This is a component that we commonly have to replace to make lights work properly.

    text: How many backyard mechanics have a thermal imaging camera?  We may work on old cars - but we have modern tools to help us fong problems fast. This is one tool in our arsenal that can show us electrical components (and wires) that are getting hot. It saves time, so we can get you back on the road faster. If you saw us on Roadkill Show - you witnessed this tool save the day.

    text: Some mechanics just swap a bunch of components hoping to get the problem solved. We’re smarter than that. We diagnose with testing tools to find the source of the problem - not just guess at it. Tools, technique, experience and knowledge is the difference.

    qaCont:
      - que: My car starts fine when it’s cold, but cranks slow or not at all when hot - what gives?
        ans: Sounds like a cable, or a starter issue. Especially problematic if the starter is surrounded by exhaust headers and getting hot. A mini-starter or a heat shield could be the cure. Or a larger starter cable - or even cleaning the connectors.
      - que: My battery keeps going dead, and I replace it. Then it goes dead again. What’s the issue?
        ans: Classic signs of a component drawing power while sitting. Sometimes the alternator is bad, or external regulator - or another component. We can run a few tests to find it.
      - que: I keep blowing a fuse - should I put in a larger one?
        ans: NEVER! EVER! EVER! Do this… you can burn down your car! Let’s find the problem and fix it right.

Hard start, no start? No problem. Gas gauge not working? Battery goes dead? Lights flickering - we gotcha!
