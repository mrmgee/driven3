    text: Don’t trust handing your keys to a shop littered with Prius(s) (or is it Priii?) - bring it to the folks that know classics, muscle cars and old schools. It’s a rare occasion you’ll find a Honda in our shop (though some of our customer love us so much they force us to work on their daily drivers as well).

    text: Battery keeps going dead? Could be the alternator, regulator or another component drawing power. Running rough and stalling - could be the carburetor, a vacuum leak or other issue. Whatever the problem is it will require a bit of time to diagnose - then repair. We cant always tell you what it is from a work request, but if it takes only a short time to fix, you’ll be charged for just that. If it takes more time and parts we’ll let you know.

      - que: Another shop, my buddy, Google - already told me what is wrong. Can you just fix it?
        ans: That mechanic, your buddy and no one named Google works here. We’ll still need to perform a proper diagnosis. Period.
      - que: I have my own parts - can you just put them on?
        ans: We shy away from this - as if it doesn’t fix the issue, or the part fails - you blame us… If we buy the parts, we know where they came from. Simply said - no warranty on parts or install if we didn’t procure the parts.
      - que: My car just broke down - can I have it towed to you right now?
        ans: We typically have a back-log of customers waiting. We’ll do our best to accommodate you but we only have so much room in the shop, and so many hours available for the work we have in and scheduled to come in. <span class="js-modal-trigger" data-target="modal-js-example">Submit a work request</span> or call first!
