    text: Let our certified techs perform a rigorous 40-point inspection to really dig into your car’s issues. Typically an inspection is the first step to diagnose problems, identify repairs, and make your vehicle safe. Even if you’ve had other shops look at your vehicle, it’s best for us to confirm the findings – and make sure nothing was missed.

      - que: Can you tell me EVERYTHING that is wrong with my car?
        ans: We can only tell you what we can see - and what our tools can see. We are not fortune tellers with a crystal ball that can tell you what is going to break next, but we have a pretty good idea of where your car is mechanically NOW.
      - que: My car hasn’t run in many years, can you get it going?
        ans: In most cases - YES INDEED. Typical issues for a car that has been sitting (besides what parked it in the first place) are - old gas, tires, tune up, oil change, coolant flush, brake flush and leaks from sitting.
