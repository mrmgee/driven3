    text: Classic car owners know today’s gasoline is significantly different from the fuel mixture available when the car was new. The different formula effects performance, especially compared to using a carburetor instead of modern computer-controlled fuel-injected systems. Today’s gasolines can cause your carburetor to shift about 3-5% leaner and also cause misfires and poor throttle response. To get the most out of your classic car’s engine, you need to retune the carburetor and distributor.

    text: If running too lean, the off-idle circuit needs to be enriched. Regardless of the carburetor brand,  we can make the right adjustments to ensure your engine gets the correct amount of fuel it needs. If the problem is throttle response, the pump circuit needs to be more active. We’ll adjust your carburetor, or recommend a high-performance replacement, that will give you power when you need it. Lastly, the ignition spark timing curve and the air-fuel mix curve should be retuned. With the proper mix and firing, we’ll make sure your classic gives you the power to make it fun to drive again.

    text: We have to tune both together for optimum results. Sometimes that means simply adjusting the carb (re re-building it) and sometimes it means upgrading the carb, or the distributor - or both.

    text: More CFM does not alway translate into more power. We’ve seen it with our own eyes on an engine dyno. That 850 double pumper with huge jets sounds cool in theory - but we’ve seen a 650 out of the box Holley make better numbers on the dyno than the bigger carb. Don’t trust your buddies, some basement dweller on the forums - trust guys who know…. And make calls to guys who know to choose the right stuff.

      - que: My carb runs super rich at idle, should I get a new one?
        ans: There's no hard or fast rule here. Sometimes we can adjust it out - or sometimes we need to make bigger changes - but on most performance engines with big cams it’s hard to make them run lean at idle..
      - que: I have a dead spot - do I need a bigger carb? Bigger jets?
        ans: Usually - NO. We can usually get it right by accelerator pump adjustments, and timing curve.
      - que: My car backfires a bunch… can you help?
        ans: Absolutely - Backfires or lean popping is all timing and carb related… we can get you dialed in and running smooth.
