    text: The first thing we do is completely disassemble the car. Every nut, bolt, piece of glass, wires, piece of trim is removed, cataloged and marked. Along the way we take notes for broken bolts, missing parts etc. From here we start a list of what we will need to complete your job in detail. Once the car is back from the media blaster - We will assess body damage and metalwork required - and which panels will be replaced or repaired.

    qaCont:
      - que: I have a really special car that you may have never worked on - can you restore it?
        ans: At this point we have seen most everything - and even if we haven’t there is enough information on concours restorations of every vehicle to arm us with the information we need to do the job right. If we feel something is out of our realm - we’ll call an expert for advice using our network.
      - que: I want all original parts - not that re-production junk… can you do that?
        ans: Sure thing - we are happy to find the right original and NOS parts. They may cost more - and the time involved to find them will be billed - but we can do it.
      - que: What’s your warranty?
        ans: We have a 25 year limited warranty on metal / paint / bodywork that is detailed in each estimate. Parts warranty is from the manufacturer, and installation is 1 year / 10,000 miles (whichever comes first) for installation.
      - que: How long will a restoration take?
        ans: This varies based on condition - but a restoration can take 4 mos. to 24 mos. depending on level of build, components and parts availability.
      - que: Can’t you just give me a flat price after looking at my car?
        ans: No way - we work on time / materials and parts. Once the car has been disassembled and blasted we can hone in closer on what it will take. But some cars need more work than others for metal and body, and some cars have parts that are expensive and hard to find.
      - que: How do you break up payments?
        ans: We take a small portion for the build spec and design work if that is a part of the process. From there we bill on a regular schedule based on job length for parts, materials and labor. The payment terms will be defined in the build spec and estimate - but in general we bill every 2 weeks for shorter jobs, and every 3-4 for more complex longer term jobs until complete. It can be 4 payments or up to 30 payments depending on the job.
      - que: My car has been in another shop for years - they have taken a bunch of money and haven’t done much work to it. Can I have it brought to you to finish?
        ans: Totally! This happens all the time… “Restoration shop jail” is a terrible place to be. Just know that we may have to re-do some of the work that they already did to make sure it was done right - and we won’t get involved with getting your car back for you.
      - que: I’m ready to go - can I have my car towed to you today?
        ans: Pump the brakes! Although our facility is 20,000 square feet - we don’t have the room to get every car in right away. Our work is in high demand and we always pre-schedule. After we have given an initial estimate and have been given approval - getting your car in to start work can be weeks away - but we’ll schedule the next slot based on that approval and a small deposit.
