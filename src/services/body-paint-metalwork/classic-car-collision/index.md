    text: You need a shop that is on your side to make sure your classic / muscle car or specialty car is repaired right. We work with your insurance adjuster to make sure that there is enough to cover getting your car back to where it was BEFORE the accident - or even better. Don’t just take their estimate - there can be deeper damage and more work involved than the initial estimate. We’ll handle it for you.

    text: We’ll need to tear down the damaged area(s) to make sure the damage isn’t deeper than we - or the insurance estimator can see. We’ve seen it happen before and it’s a bummer. We’d rather get the estimate right then get surprises at the end.

    text: Hopefully you have an agreed value policy from a reputable specialty insurance company like Hagerty or Grundy that is high enough. A crash can cost more than you think - and the extra coverage isn’t that much in premium per year. Want an opinion on coverage - we can help you out.

    qaCont:
      - que: Do you charge for insurance estimates?
        ans: Yes, a small fee of $250. Why? Because many people go from shop to shop looking for the highest estimate, get a check and cash it and never do the work. Proper insurance estimates take time and we need to be paid for that time. If we do the work - we apply the fee to the job.
      - que: Can you just fix it for less, and give me the rest?
        ans: Absolutely not.
      - que: Can you inflate the estimate to be sure I get enough?
        ans: That would be insurance fraud - and we won’t go there. What we will do is make sure our estimate is enough for us to make the repairs.
      - que: My insurance company had my car Towed to a yard - can I get it to you now?
        ans: Sometimes. We’ll do our best to make room and start the process depending on your insurer.
