    text: Imagine knowing your baby is safe and sound while you are at work, on vacation - Anywhere! We install CompuStar alarm systems with Drone GPS so that you can see from your phone where your car is, it can alert you if it moves, the battery is low and more. Pretty slick eh?

    text: You can hide 10 air tags in your car and the app will tell you where your car was - not where it is. You can chase that thief for days while he’s joy riding your whip. Air tags don’t work real time…. And unless your car is stationary they will not tell you where your car is.

    text: We can add a back up camera just like a modern car. Don’t risk scratching your ride when you put it to bed - we can hide the screen under the dash and put the camera on the license plate so you’ll barely know it’s there.

      - que: I already have an alarm - can you just add the GPS?
        ans: Only if the alarm is from Compustar sure. Swapping the system isn’t a big deal.
      - que: What other features can I get
        ans: Check out <a href="https://www.dronemobile.com/how-it-works" target="_blank">https://www.dronemobile.com/how-it-works</a> for a full list. 
      - que: Is there a subscription fee?
        ans: Is anything free? This technology uses LTE data - so yes, they charge a fee - but it’s pretty small for the piece of mind.
      - que: What about LoJack?
        ans: They have gone a different direction and no longer do this.
