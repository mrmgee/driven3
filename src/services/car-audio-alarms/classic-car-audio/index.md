Ordering direct from Morel gives us access to all of their components - as well as technical staff so when it comes to speakers, amplifiers, sound deadening materials they are our go to guys and gals.

    text: That’s quite a mouthful right? In layman's terms it means that these speakers a so thin, that we don’t have to hack holes in your car to install them - and they sound F’n amazing! No more scraping the speaker with the parking brake pedal. No holes in the lower cowls. Heck, in some cases we can surface mount them because they are so thin.

      - que: Will you have to cut up my dash?
        ans: Absolutely not. We can make a Retrosound radio or other classic car radio work in most any car and look like it belongs.
      - que: I want hands free-calling - can you do that?
        ans: We do it all the time. All of the units we install have these features.
      - que: I really like another brand, not Morel - can you use that instead?
        ans: Sure thing. We’re happy to install any brand.
