    text: Protect your baby. Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer that chemically bonds with your vehicle’s paint. It hardens like glass on top of your clearcoat to make it more scratch resistant and protects from harmful UV rays. Unlike wax or sealants, long-lasting ceramic coatings won’t wear off, repels water for easier maintenance, and gives a deeper, glossier shine.
